For my best supervisor Alan.
I would like to extend my heartfelt gratitude to Alan Huang for his invaluable guidance and communication; he is truly the best teacher I have ever had. As we work half a year on this project, I am deeply appreciative of the time Alan has dedicated to our discussions every Friday and Monday, as well as his willingness to accommodate Zoom meetings. Each conversation with Alan has provided me with a sense of comfort and has been one of the rare sources of solace in my life this year.

Let's Go Bulls!
I eagerly anticipate the day when the Bulls face off against the Warriors in the finals, even if the odds are a mere 1 in 10,000. 
But We hold fast to the spirit of sports, and more to statistics.
